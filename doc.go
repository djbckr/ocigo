/*

Package oci is an Oracle database driver for Go targeting the OCI (Oracle Call Interface).
By design, it does *not* follow the database/sql generic interface. While I really like
Go, I find that the database/sql interface rather lacking, really for any database but
especially Oracle and the features it has. I would like to see Go v2 come up with a
better database interface.
